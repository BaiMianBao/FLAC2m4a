This is my first from scratch personal python program.

I run it on a cron to convert my FLAC files into ALAC files
so I can have lossless audio on my iDevices.

TODO:

Looks like the github user account I made is typod:  mainbao, not mianbao

I ran this:
git remote add origin https://github.com/mianbao/FLAC2m4a.git
servy:~/Scripts/FLAC2m4a> git push origin master
Username for 'https://github.com': mainbao^C

So I need to sort that out...

Also my passwd on github is stored in lastpass and I don't actually know it 
myself.  That could be a problem too.
